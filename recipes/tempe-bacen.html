    <h2>Tahu Tempe Bacen aka Braised Tofu Tempeh</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Tempe dan Tahu Bacem (Javanese Braised Tempeh and Tofu) is one of
      Indonesian tofu and tempeh dishes. It originated in Jogjakarta or
      Yogyakarta in Central Java. The food from that area tends to be sweeter.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it is not overly sweet since they balance it with tamarind water
      and other spices making it very flavorful. Bacem means slowly boiling in
      low heat. Because of the way it is cooked, the tofu and tempeh become very
      flavorful. So, if you know anyone who doesn't like tofu due to its bland
      flavor, this is the recipe you should try because all the spices are
      absorbed during boiling making them very flavorful.
